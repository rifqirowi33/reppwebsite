Yeaaayyyyy.... I ate a lot of food today, I chewed and swallowed all the food, and then it went into my stomach.
I am so Happy and Very full... In the afternoon, I had carrot soup, eggs, fried soybeas and rice. and in the evening, 
I was offered food again, so I had ShowToo and I finished three plates of it. Oh, it was so delicious... But, Errrgghhh...
My burp smells like rotten egg.
Oh NO! I might Have Acid Reflux :').
