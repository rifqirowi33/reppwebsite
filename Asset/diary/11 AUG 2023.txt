My friend left me. He was going to move to a boarding house. 
Even though he was well received at my place, he chose to move to a boarding house. 
Why would my friend opt for a place like a boarding house when staying here at my place was free? 
It didn't cost him anything, unlike his new boarding house which now costs him $23. I don't understand. 
My friend's behavior is quite perplexing. I had assisted him in settling here. 
I'm growing increasingly frustrated with him $$$@$@$@##$@@$#@$#.
