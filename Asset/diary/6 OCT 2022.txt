I bought a laptop for $500, which has 11th generation Intel Core i3 specs, along with an additional dedicated Nvidia MX350 VGA with 4GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It is sufficient to support my needs in various computing fields, such as typing papers/scripts, programming, editing images/photos, and even videos. Moreover, it allows me to enjoy entertainment, like streaming the most complete free movies through software recommended by my friend, and playing video games in my spare time.
