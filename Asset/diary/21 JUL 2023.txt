Tonight, my friend and I watched a stand-up comedy show in a caf√©. 
There were 8 comedians performing at the time, and laughter filled the room, 
possibly due to the jokes delivered by the two show readers. As the 8 comedians took turns performing, 
many of the audience members laughed because they were entertained, but I didn't find it as amusing. 
I felt obliged to laugh to show my appreciation for the material presented, 
perhaps because my jokes are not as lighthearted as those conveyed by the 8 comedians who appeared tonight.
