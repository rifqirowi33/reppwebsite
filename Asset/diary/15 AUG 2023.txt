This afternoon, I accompanied my sister's cousin to go to the university. 
Many new students gathered here it's like a market, but not exactly a market. 
My younger cousin also submitted the required documents. 
After collecting the files, we searched for a place to live, 
and we didn't forget to visit another female cousin who lives not far from the university.
