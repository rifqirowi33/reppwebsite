7 SEPT 2022
I went back to the hospital where I was treated to check the progress of my surgery. 
There I met my surgeon again, the doctor told me to lie on a bed,
and a nurse removed the bandage and also removed the broken cast,
then the nurse pulled out the thread from the improved stitches, 
at this time I was forced to endure extreme pain... it feels like I want to scream... aaaarrrgghhhh!!
