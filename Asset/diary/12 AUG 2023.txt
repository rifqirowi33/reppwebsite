I went to a cafe near my place to learn how to create a website using WordPress. 
It turns out that setting the layout on WordPress is more difficult than designing the layout with coding. 
Because of that, I prefer making sites with coding rather than without coding. 
However, I'm continuously learning so that I can become proficient in both methods. Hehehe.
