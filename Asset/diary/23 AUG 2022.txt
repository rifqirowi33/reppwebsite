I'm going to have surgery this morning, this is my first experience... The beautiful nurse came into my room to pick me up and escorted me to a room that was very cold, maybe the temperature was like a refrigerator in my house, I was immediately carried by the assistant surgeon into the surgical room, there I was placed in a surgical bed and then the assistant surgeons prepared tools while talking to me to reduce my tension, then injected anesthetic into me..... A few seconds later I felt sleepy and finally everything was dark....
