Hello World! My name is Repp.

I've created this site to share my ideas, works, and sometimes i wrote diaries... hehehe, for those who's curious you can read DIARY section.

I developed this website using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages.

Although it may look simple, more project and interesting features will come.

And of course all changes will happen whenever i make updates.
